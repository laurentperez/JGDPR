# JGDPR
Java based tooling for complying with the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR (EU) 2016/679

GDPR country aliases for France, Italy are : RGPD, Germany : DSGVO, Neerlands : AVG 

This is mostly a set of :

- annotations
- interfaces you are free to implement to comply with the regulation
- utility, framework free classes
- text or schema based resources (i.e regulation implementation guides or tips, no MS Powerpoints or Apple Keynotes please, .odt/.md/any OSS format is ok)

PR are welcome ! Java/Kotlin friendly

Note : this work is **not** endorsed by any EU IT department, this is a pure collaborative effort for developers
