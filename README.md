# JGDPR
Java based tooling for the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR (EU) 2016/679
GDPR country aliases for France, Italy : RGPD, Germany : DSGVO, Neerlands : AVG 

This is mostly a set of :

- annotations
- interfaces you are free to implement to comply with the regulation
- utility or abstract classes
- text or schema based resources (i.e regulation guides or tips, no Powerpoints please, .odt is ok)

PR are welcome ! Java/Kotlin friendly

This work is **not** endorsed by any EU department, this is a pure collaborative effort
